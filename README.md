A task for using GroupBy function with csv using php

# How to run
Please make sure to have PHP installed
Download the file and put the csv in the same directary
And then use the command line to run this code: php -S localhost:8000
Later on, open up the browser with the localhost:8000 url
The result should be printed out

# Things to improve
1. The IU printout
2. The information also contains the date, it would be cool if the user can press on a section and it shows all the detail of the information
3. If interactions can be made between the interface and the user, it can be better
4. Now the information is only run in php. If the data is larger, it might exceed 30 seconds of php running limitation
